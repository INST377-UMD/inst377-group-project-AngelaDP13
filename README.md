Email Validator

The problem we are hoping to solve is users signing up for company services while using spam/fake emails. 
The stakeholders for this project are company executives who rely on the service to generate revenue for 
the company and if our solution impacts the companies ability to turn a profit as well as the user base of the website. 
Our solution would allow the company to input email addresses and return if the email address is valid, in order to do 
this we chose to work with the EVA api to vet email addresses. The front end technology will be a dynamic web page that 
allows the user to check one or multiple email addresses at a time to determine which of the addresses are spam.
